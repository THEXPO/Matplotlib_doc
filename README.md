This repository contains short, easy-to-run Python scripts demonstrating Matplotlib syntax and concepts.
It’s meant to be a practical reference for quickly understanding how different plots work — by running small, focused code examples instead of reading long tutorials.

Each file covers one concept or plot type:
Basic Plotting – line plots, markers, labels, titles
Subplots & Layouts – plt.subplot, plt.subplots, figure size
Customization – colors, styles, legends, grids, axes limits
Common Plots – bar, scatter, histogram, pie, boxplot
Integration – combining Matplotlib with NumPy

How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
      git clone https://github.com/THEXPO/Matplotlib_doc.git
   cd matplotlib-quick-guide

2. Open any file and run it:
   
3.Modify parameters and re-run to instantly see how syntax changes affect the plot.
